# FFmpeg Dependency Analysis

## Current Situation
The `ytproc` CLI tool currently relies on FFmpeg being installed on the host system. This creates several challenges:
1. Users must manually install FFmpeg
2. Different installation methods across operating systems
3. Version compatibility issues
4. Additional setup steps for users

## Proposed Solution: Self-Contained FFmpeg

### Option 1: Bundled FFmpeg Binaries
**Description**: Include FFmpeg binaries directly in the package
**Implementation**:
- Download FFmpeg binaries during package installation
- Store binaries in package directory
- Use relative paths to locate binaries

**Pros**:
- No system dependency required
- Consistent version across all installations
- Simpler user experience
- Works offline after installation

**Cons**:
- Increased package size (~50-100MB)
- Platform-specific binaries needed
- Need to maintain multiple binary versions
- Potential security concerns with bundled binaries

### Option 2: FFmpeg as Optional Dependency
**Description**: Make FFmpeg an optional dependency with automatic download
**Implementation**:
- Check for system FFmpeg first
- Download and install if not found
- Cache downloaded binaries

**Pros**:
- Smaller initial package size
- Flexible installation options
- Better for users who already have FFmpeg
- Can use system FFmpeg when available

**Cons**:
- More complex installation process
- Requires internet connection for first use
- Need to handle download failures
- Version management complexity

## Size Analysis

### FFmpeg Binary Sizes (Approximate)
- Windows (64-bit): ~50MB
- Linux (64-bit): ~30MB
- macOS (64-bit): ~40MB

### Package Size Impact
Current package size: ~5MB
With bundled FFmpeg:
- Windows: ~55MB
- Linux: ~35MB
- macOS: ~45MB

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Binary Management
1. Create binary management system
2. Implement platform detection
3. Add binary download functionality
4. Create binary verification system

### Phase 2: Integration
1. Modify FFmpeg path handling
2. Add binary caching
3. Implement fallback mechanisms
4. Add progress indicators

### Phase 3: Testing
1. Add platform-specific tests
2. Test binary verification
3. Test download failures
4. Test caching system

## Security Considerations
1. Verify binary integrity using checksums
2. Use HTTPS for downloads
3. Implement binary signature verification
4. Regular security updates

## Performance Impact
1. Initial download time: ~1-2 minutes
2. Binary loading: Negligible
3. Memory usage: ~50MB additional
4. Disk space: ~50-100MB additional

## Recommendation
Based on the analysis, we recommend implementing Option 1 (Bundled FFmpeg Binaries) because:
1. Simplest user experience
2. Most reliable solution
3. Consistent behavior across platforms
4. No internet dependency after installation

The increased package size is acceptable given the improved user experience and reliability.

## Next Steps
1. Create binary management system
2. Implement platform-specific binary handling
3. Add binary verification
4. Update documentation
5. Add tests for new functionality
